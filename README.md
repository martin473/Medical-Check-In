new.sql is the database. This was originally hosted using xampp, 
which expects you to import the file into phpmyadmin's database import feature. The database needs to be named "new" for the project to work.

The project should have a login page, where you can choose your user type.

Once logged in, the db server should return the proper login page for your usertype.

Each page has different views. Uses an AJAX/PHP/MySQL API, using POST requests and JSON to handle data retreival.
